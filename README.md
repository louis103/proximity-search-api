### A simple API in Node.js that receives latitude,longitude and radius and returns all features within that radius. It uses the ST_Within function of PostGIS to achieve this
### How to run this Node.js API?
### Start by cloning the project by typing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louis103/proximity-search-api.git
```

## Change into the folder by typing

```bash
cd proximity-search-api
```

## Then type the following to install dependencies

```bash
npm install || npm i
```

## Once done, the next step is to start the server

```bash
npm start 
```

### This opens the application on port 3000

You can use Postman to run different queries and see how the API works.
